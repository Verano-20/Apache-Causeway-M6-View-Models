= SimpleApp M6 viewModelInit debugging

SimpleObjectPage is a view model representation of SimpleObject.
The idea is to fetch the data for SimpleObject from an external service and display it in the same way.
Currently the data is still fetched using internal repositories as a placeholder.

By watching the logs on loading a SimpleObjectPage, it is seen that viewModelInit() is called multiple times, hence multiple calls to fetch the data are made.
This causes poor performance in larger apps.
